Hello! I am a 28 years old self-taught junior front-end developer from Lviv, Ukraine. During last 2 years I have dedicated my time to learning as much as I can by using all resources at my disposal. I am following new trends and eager to learn new technologies and tools. Now, I\`m actively looking for full-time web development job opportunities, which will allow me to improve my computing skills and grow as a junior front-end web developer.  

Here is a list of languages, libraries and tools which I have used in my projects:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- SASS
- Gulp
- vanilla JavaScript (ES6)
- jQuery
- Bootstrap4
- MySQL  

Also I have en experience in working with:
- Git
- Adobe Photoshop, Avocode
- BEM methodology  

Please, take a look on example of my code below:

```javascript
function persistence(num) {
  
  let counter = 0;

  let multiply = function (num) {

  	let numArr = (num.toString()).split('');
    
    if (numArr.length <= 1) {
      return 0;
    }
    
    numArr = numArr.map(current => +current);
    
    let res = numArr.reduce((mult, current) => mult * current);
    counter++;
    
    return multiply(res);
  }

  multiply(num);

  return counter;
}
```  

You can also find my projects on [my personal web-site](http://www.oksana-shuptar.me).
